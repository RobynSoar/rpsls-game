### Version Control

The site was created using the Git editor and pushed to GitHUb to the remote repository 'rpsls-game'

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repository:

```git add <file>``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are commited.

```git commit -m "commit message"``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready to be pushed.

```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository 'rpsls-game' on GitHub.

### Deployment to GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the 'Settings' tab
2. From the menu called 'Code and automation' on the left, select 'Pages'
3. From the Default branch drop down menu, select 'Main'
4. Click 'Save'
5. A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published succesfully.

The live link to 'rpsls-game' can be found here - [Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Live]()
